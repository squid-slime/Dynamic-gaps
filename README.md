# Dynamic-gaps
auto sizing gaps, with each window added to a workspace gaps are adjusted.
i made this script as for using my ultrawide monitor so things like single 
workspace's with a single application will render in a more readable way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
add `exec python /path/to/script.py` to your sway config.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
customise by adding more windows or adjusting hoz, ver and inner values 
within the .py file.
